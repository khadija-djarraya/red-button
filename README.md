# <Your-Project-Title>

## Description

This is an interactive website representing a red button. If you click on it, you should deal with its consequences...
 
- Motivation: Build a funny website that anyone can use when they want to be entertained.
- It was an entertaining idea that can easily be improved and additional features could be implemented.
- It solves the problem we all face everyday: Boredom!
- I learned how to style a website with TailwindCSS (simpler than expected!) and how to use states and event handlers.
